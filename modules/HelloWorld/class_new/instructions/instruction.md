# Class Exercise

## Class new and delete

T the class call ‘DataClass’ add two ‘int’ data members.  Add a constructor to initialise these data members.

Add member operator functions new and delete to allocate and free ‘DataClass’ objects.  Within these operators it will be sufficient to defer to the global new and delete operators.

To enable confirmation that these operators are call add output within the new and delete operators.

Within the main function dynamically allocate a number of ‘DataClass’ objects and ensure these are deleted.
